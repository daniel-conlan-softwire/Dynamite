# Don't use Water if Opponent ran out of dynamite


# If just used N=1 waterbombs, use dynamite


# If we have a bunch of "simple" bots (and none perform significantly better than the other), then we can split the game to (say 200) rounds 
# and switch to a different strategy based on the aggregate data of the previoud round (e.g. if opponent does mostly scissors, then switch to rockbot next)


# (Can set N number of waterbombs based on data from previous rounds)


# Assign weights to each possible moves (e.g. for random)


# CONSIDER ROLL OVER


# Keep track of roll over 


# How to decide when to waterbomb or dynamite on round with bonus rollover points?


# Rollover response depends on how much dynamite the enemy has left (weight probability with that)


# Offensive -> dynamite, defensive -> water bomb, going for the draw -> rock paper scissors
